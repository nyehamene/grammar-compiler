# Formatter

Formats input files inplace. If an error is found
the file containing the error is not modified, and
the program reports the errors and exit with a non-zero
exit code after formatting all the input files.

- Implement `grammar fmt PATH`.
- Add tests using the rules described below.
- Implement `grammar fmt --stdin`.

## Formating rules

1. Rule Grouping: alignment of consecutive rules.
  Rules not separated by a blank line should be aligned
  so that the value separator `=` are on the same column.

  For example,

  Before:
  ```grammar
  a = "a";
  bar = "bar";

  b = "a";
  name = "name";
  ```

  After:
  ```grammar
  a   = "a";
  bar = "bar";

  b    = "a";
  name = "name";
  ```

2. Add a space around values inside grouping symbols
  like `(` and `)`, `[` and `]`, `{` and `}`, etc.

  For example,

  Before:
  ```grammmar
  one = (foo);
  two = [bar];
  xxx = {baz};
  ```

  After:
  ```grammar
  one = ( foo );
  two = [ bar ];
  xxx = { baz };
  ```

3. Add a space around the alternative separator `|`.

  Before:
  ```grammar
  foo = a|b;
  ```

  After:
  ```grammar
  foo = a | b;
  ```

4. Production (or expression) Group: alignment of expression.
  When arranging alternative vertically, align the
  value separator `=`, alternative separator `|`
  and rule separator `;` on the same column.

  Before:
  ```grammar
  choice = one
     | two
     | three ;
  ```

  After:
  ```grammar
  choice = one
         | two
         | three
         ;
  ```

5. Trim consecutive blank lines.

  Before:
  ```grammar
  foo = "one";


  bar = "bar";
  ```

  After:
  ```grammar
  foo = "one";

  bar = "bar";
  ```

Combing rule 1 and 4, given the following text:

Before:
```grammar
x = "one";
xxx = "one"
  | "two"
  | "three";
xx = "two";
```
After formatting should produce the following:

After:
```grammar
x    = "one";
xxxx = "one"
     | "two"
     | "three"
     ;
xx   = "two";
```

The rules are grouped together before there is blank line separating.
The productions in the second rule is also aligned to match the group
alignment before it spans multiple lines.

## Example

Formatting the following text:

```grammar
/// @var
document = @import("document.grammar");
component = @import("component.grammar");

/// @ast
Source = DocumentNamespace | ComponentNamespace;
DocumentNamespace = document;
ComponentNamespace = component;
```

Should output the following:
```grammar
/// @var
document  = @import("document.grammar");
component = @import("component.grammar");

/// @ast
Source             = DocumentNamespace | ComponentNamespace;
DocumentNamespace  = document;
ComponentNamespace = component;
```
